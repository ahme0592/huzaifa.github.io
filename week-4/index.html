<h2> About Me</h2>
<p> Hi I'm Huzaifa, and Im 18 years old. My birthday is on October 6<sup>th</sup>, 2005
    My favourite hobbies are playing badminton and <em>video editing</em>.  I always
    try to play badminton with my dad and at one point tried going competitive but failed.
    Video editing is my pasion where I have a channel.
</p>

<p> On youtube where I post my videos that I've edited.
    I was born in <abbr title="Windsor">Canada</abbr> and my parents were born in Pakistan. I also like watching anime and movies. Also,
    I like working out and made it my goal to become as strong as I can.
The reason why I also took this program is because I am passionate about video editing
and curious about learning how to code and other art related stuff.
Hopefully at the end of the program I know how to do all of those!  </p>
